# Browser Supprot

This application supports the following browsers

- Chrome >= 70
- Firefox >= 60
- Safari >= 12
- Opera >= 64
- Edge >= 81

We do not officially support any version of IE or any browser not listed here,
but don't go out of your way to not support it! Please make an issue if any of
this should change. This list is generally based on which browsers are sending
meaningful traffic to DEV and covers 99.x percent of traffic.

Edge is listed here in more speculation. We do not support any version of Edge
on its outgoing "EdgeHTML" engine.
